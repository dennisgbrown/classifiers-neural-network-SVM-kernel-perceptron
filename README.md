# comp6636-miniproj2-classifiers

This Mini-project looks at training accuracy and classification error using 2-layer Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, and Kernel Perceptron. The project uses the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) database of 60,000 handwritten digits 0 to 9, where the samples are 780-pixel bitmaps of the digit images.

See [COMP6636_MiniProj2.pdf](https://github.com/dennisgbrown/comp6636-miniproj2-classifiers/blob/main/COMP6636_MiniProj2.pdf) for more details.
